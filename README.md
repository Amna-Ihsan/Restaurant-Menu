# Dynamic Restaurant Menu

This project showcases a dynamic restaurant menu that updates based on user selection. The menu categories include **Breakfast**, **Lunch**, **Shakes**, and **Dinner**. When a user clicks on a button for a specific category, the menu related to that category will display, allowing users to explore different meal options.

## Features

- **Dynamic Menu**: The menu updates dynamically based on the selected category.
- **Category Buttons**: Buttons for **Breakfast**, **Lunch**, **Shakes**, and **Dinner** are available for users to filter and view the related menu.
- **Interactive Design**: The page is interactive and provides users with an intuitive experience to explore various food and drink options.


## How It Works

1. **HTML Structure**: The page consists of a container where buttons and menu items will be dynamically added using JavaScript..
   
2. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - JavaScript listens for button clicks (for **Breakfast**, **Lunch**, **Shakes**, and **Dinner**).
   - When a button is clicked, the corresponding menu is dynamically loaded by updating the content displayed on the page.
   - Menu items are stored in an array or object in JavaScript, and based on the category selected, the relevant menu items are displayed.

3. **CSS Styling**: The page is styled for a clean, responsive layout. Each category has a distinct section with items listed in an easy-to-read format.
